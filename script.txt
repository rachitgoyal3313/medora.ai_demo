🎤 MUKUL (0:00 – 0:20) – Introduction
“Hello Everyone!! We are Team Evolve AI — Mukul, Kushagra, Rachit, and Moksh.
India’s healthcare system is advancing digitally, but core ground-level problems still persist.
We’ve created a solution that brings Generative AI to the frontlines of care—bridging gaps between systems, people, and languages.
In the next two minutes, we’ll show how we’re not just using AI—we’re using it to evolve healthcare.”

🎤 KUSHAGRA (0:20 – 0:45) – Problem Understanding
“In India, doctors often spend more time filling out records than treating patients.
Handwritten prescriptions cause errors, and reports don’t travel between departments.
In rural clinics, there’s a shortage of 80% specialists, and with 1,500+ dialects, language barriers delay care.
Patients often miss doses or don’t understand instructions.
This results in miscommunication, inefficiency, and ultimately—lower quality care.”

🎤 RACHIT (0:45 – 1:03) – Gen-AI Solution Part 1
“Our solution is a Gen-AI-powered Healthcare Assistant that reimagines the clinical workflow:

It reads handwritten prescriptions and reports using OCR and medical NLP

Doctors can simply speak, and our Gen-AI generates structured, digital prescriptions in real time

Medical reports and test results are routed automatically across departments—no paper, no delay”

🎤 MOKSH (1:03 – 1:20) – Gen-AI Solution Part 2
“Patients use a smart companion app that gives AI-generated medicine reminders, and even confirms intake using voice or camera.
It supports multiple Indian languages and accents, so even rural health workers can enter or access records hands-free.
Our system ensures efficiency for hospitals and accessibility for patients—everywhere in India.”

🎤 MUKUL (1:20 – 2:00) – Innovation, Impact & Business Model
“What sets Evolve AI apart is our end-to-end use of Gen-AI—from data capture to doctor input to patient follow-through.
It’s fully aligned with the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, supports multilingual voice input, and scales from clinics to cities.
Our business model is a B2B SaaS solution for hospitals and healthcare providers, with a freemium mobile app for patients.
We offer AI-as-a-service that saves time, reduces errors, and empowers every user—from urban hospitals to rural villages.

We’re not just digitizing healthcare—we’re evolving it.
We are Team Evolve AI. Thank you.”
